# Custom Checkout for Blocksy

Hi folks,

I am sharing my CSS code and snippets that can help you style your order page. Please take into account that the code was written for a specific site. When I created it, I didn't think I'd share it. Please check the code before adding it to the site and contribute your improvements. I hope the code I shared will help you improve the look of your site.
